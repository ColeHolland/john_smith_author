            <h3>September 29, 2016</h3>
            <p>Today had this crazy dream. I had i dream that I had to deliver a straw to someone in Jordan. My only method of transportation was a bouncy house. I was bouncing my way to Jordan, but I had to go to the grocery store to buy cream cheese. As I was bouncing, my bouncy house deflated. It was flying all over the place. I had to outrun the deflated bouncy in thirty seconds, or else my mission to get the straw to Jordan failed. I was able to outrun the deflated bouncy house, and then I found myself in New York City. I accidentally dropped my straw in a hill filled with garbage and lost it. I asked the garbage man where my straw was, but the dream ended before he had a chance to answer. I told my sister about this dream and she thought I was on crack.</p>

            <p>Hello fans, thank you for reading my blog. I have been very busy working on a new book and can't wait to finish it up here in the next few weeks. Writing a book can be very time-consuming, but it will be worth it in the end. Please stay tuned so I can give you some hints on what it is about. I also have an Instagram and a Twitter account, so follow me both at johnsmith. If you see a Tumblr account from official_john_smith claiming that it's me, it's not. I do not have a Tumblr account, so beware.</p>

            <p>Fans, I am beyond excited to announce that I will be on the panel at Geekycon next year. I will be doing a Q&amp;A on my newest book Barefoot Trucker at the Fairmount room, so ask me any of your questions. I will be out signing autographs. I hope to see all my fans and I hope to see a lot of people cosplaying. Last year I cosplayed as Garfield if any one remembered that. This year I am cosplaying as Dr. Seuss because I loved reading his books with I was a child.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all the support you have given me. My book, Men of the Mountain, is now a number 1 seller. I am now currently working on my newest book Barefoot Trucker, and I hope for all of your support for this book. I am currently at a gas station interviewing truckers hoping they would give me inspiration on my book. One thing that I learned is never eat gas station sushi. I am pretty sure that the spicy tuna rolls that I ate had mold in it, but the taquitos were good.</p>
