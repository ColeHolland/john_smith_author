            <h3>September 12, 2016</h3>
            <p>Hello fans, thank you for reading my blog. I have been very busy working on a new book and can't wait to finish it up here in the next few weeks. Writing a book can be very time-consuming, but it will be worth it in the end. Please stay tuned so I can give you some hints on what it is about. I also have an Instagram and a Twitter account, so follow me both at johnsmith. If you see a Tumblr account from official_john_smith claiming that it's me, it's not. I do not have a Tumblr account, so beware.</p>

            <h3>September 1, 2016</h3>
            <p>Fans, I am beyond excited to announce that I will be on the panel at Geekycon next year. I will be doing a Q&amp;A on my newest book Barefoot Trucker at the Fairmount room, so ask me any of your questions. I will be out signing autographs. I hope to see all my fans and I hope to see a lot of people cosplaying. Last year I cosplayed as Garfield if any one remembered that. This year I am cosplaying as Dr. Seuss because I loved reading his books with I was a child.</p>

            <h3>August 15, 2016</h3>
            <p>Thank you for all the support you have given me. My book, Men of the Mountain, is now a number 1 seller. I am now currently working on my newest book Barefoot Trucker, and I hope for all of your support for this book. I am currently at a gas station interviewing truckers hoping they would give me inspiration on my book. One thing that I learned is never eat gas station sushi. I am pretty sure that the spicy tuna roll that I eat had mold in it, but the taquitos were good.</p>
